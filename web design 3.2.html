      Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the
      production and maintenance of websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user
      interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and
      proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search
      engine optimization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of
      the design process, although some designers will cover them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process
      relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including
      writing markup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web
      development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability
      and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.
